google_voice_life_alert

this program is meant to send someone to send a text message at the push of a button. created to be used with a raspberry pi so that if there is some sort of emergency, then family members can be contacted and further action can be taken. It is mainly based around the pygvoicelib library by https://github.com/korylprince/pygvoicelib 

I created this as an emergency allert system in my houshold.
